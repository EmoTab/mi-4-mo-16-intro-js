// Quotient in division which is very normal for us
var mangoes = 10;
var person = 2;
// console.log(mangoes/person); //result will be 5 which is quotient of this division, here we are using / sign called division operator


//if we do this
var mangoes = 11;
var person = 2;
// console.log(mangoes/person); //the result will be 5.5 which is both quotient and remainder together in devimal number.


//Remain in division
var mangoes = 7;
var person = 2;
// console.log(mangoes%person); //result will be 1 which is the remainder of ths division, here we are using % sign called modulus operator

//or

var mangoes = 7;
var person = 2;
var remainder = mangoes % person;
console.log(remainder);
